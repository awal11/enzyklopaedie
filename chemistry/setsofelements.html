    Sets of chemical elements
</h2>


<p>
    The chemical elements are subdivided into sets on the periodic table. Each element of one set has similar characteristics with the others. There are following nsets:

<h3 id='alkalimetals'> Alkali Metals </h3>
<p>
    The alkali metals are the 6 elements in the group 1 of the periodic table. They would be lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium and francium. The name “alkali metals” comes from the fact that they react with water and form alkalis (strong bases neutralizing acids). Most alkali metals are very rare, although two of them, sodium and potassium, are very common.
</p>
<p>
    They are highly reactive and are usually found combined with other elements. Their reactions are often very violent. They are rarely found as pure elements in the nature. Francium is a natural radioactive isotope and it’s so rare that it wasn’t known until 1939.
</p>
<p>
    Some of the main characteristics of the alkali metals are the silver-like lustre, the high ductility and the very high conductivity of electricity and heat, similar to the ones of the other metals. They also have low melting points. Lithium, one of the alkali metals, is the lightest known metal. They also tend to change into ions when they react with non-metals. This causes the compounds of alkali metals and non-metals to have a high melting point. They react very good with the nonmetals, because of their electropositivity. They oxidate easier than other metals and their reactions with water are often violent. They also react with other non-metals.
</p>
<p>
    They are often used industrially. Sodium is the most used for industry. Many substances, like salt, baking powder, etc. contain sodium. It is also used as a heat-conducting fluid in nuclear reactors. Another widely used alkali metal is lithium. It is very useful, because of it’s low weight. Alloys are made with it. Another very known example are the lithium batteries.

<h3 id='alkineearthmetals'> Alkine-earth Metals </h3>
<p>
    The alkaline-earth metals are 6 metals of the group 2. Their names are beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium and radium. They are very similar to the metals of the group 1, the alkali metals. They easily lose electrons and become cations. The oxides resulting after reactions are basic (= alkaline  = not acidic), although it varies. Beryllium oxide is more amphoteric (reactive with both acids and bases), whereas barium oxide is strongly basic. They are also highly reactive, e.g. magnesium reacts very violently with oxygen.
</p>
<p>
    All alkaline-earth metals have a commercial use, except radium, which is highly radioactive. Magnesium is used e.g. in sports, while calcium is used e.g. in medical industry.
</p>
<p>
    Alkaline-earth metals are very good conductors. They also have a very light gray color when they are freshly cut. They aren’t necessarily all hard, some of them are barely harder than lead. Their melting and boiling points are harder than the ones of the alkali metals. Their atoms have similar structures and all of them easily become ions. Similar to the alkali metals, they form compounds by having valens electrons, electrons shared by two atoms, there are exceptions though.
