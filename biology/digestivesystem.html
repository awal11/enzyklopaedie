<h2> The Digestive System </h2>
<p>
    The digestive system is responsible for the digestion of food and the extraction of  nutrients, so that the body can later use them. Digestive system has two types of organs: the organs connected to the digestive tract (i.e. stomach, esophagus, etc.) and the subsidary organs of the digestion (i.e. liver, gall bladder, etc.). While the organs that belong to the digestive tract are directly involved with the processing of food, i.e. the nutrition goes through them, the subsidary organs only help digesting the food by producing substances. These substances chemically decompose the food.

<h3 id='mouth'> the Mouth </h3>


<p>
    The mouth (latin: os) is the first stop for the food inserted  in our body. It’s also the “entrance” for it and is a part of the digetive tract. With help of the teeth and the tongue, it starts crushing the food mechanically.
    The salivary glands are connected to the mouth and send saliva inside of it, that mixes the crushed food to a mash so it’s not to difficult to swallow it. After the food has been processed, it goes in the food pipe and starts its way to the stomach.
</p>
<p>
    The saliva has different enzymes (e.g. amylase). They start the digestion of the carbohydrates. There are also oral microorganisms, that also help with the digestion. The microorganisms are located between the teeth, on the tongue and in the mucosa.
</p>
<p>
    The taste buds are placed on the tongue. They have many receptor cells, that make us taste. They perceive the taste after they come in contact with the taste substances, that are dissolved in saliva. The saliva also has the task of preventing the mucosa from drying. It also has the function of neutralizing the pH so it doesn’t damage our body.
</p>
<p>
    The mouth muscles also show the emotions we are having through laughing, smiling, etc.

<h3 id='foodpipe'> Esophagus/Food Pipe </h3>
<p>
    The esophagus (also spelled oesophagus) is a muscular tube. Food goes through it from the mouth to the stomach. The food pipe can contract and expand to allow food to pass through. The location of the esophagus is behind the trachea and the heart and in front of the spine. Both ends are closed off by the sphincters (the anterior and the upper). They are muscular narrowings at both ends of the food pipe.
</p>
<p>
    The upper sphincter is basically made of circular muscle tissues, which stay closed almost the shole time. They relax if food has to enter the food pipe. Moments after the food entered the esophagus the sphincter closes. By doing this it prevents the nutrition from coming back. Contractions of the peristalsis move the food to the stomach. Once it reached the anterior sphincter, this opens and lets the food enter the stomach, where it can be digested by gastric juices.
</p>


<h3 id='stomach'> Stomach </h3>
<p>
    The stomach is the organ where a part of the digestion takes place. The gastric juices process the food chemically. After that it mechanically distributes the food into the intestines.
</p>
<p>
    The human stomach is subdivided into four regions. The cardiac opening (opening from the esophagus into the stomach), the “body” (the central and largest region), the antrum (the lowermost portion) and the pylorus (contraction where food enters the intestine). Each opening (the cardiac and the pyloric) are closed by sphincter muscles, that only open when the food is ready for the final phases of its digestion.
</p>
<p>
    The stomach is able to contract if there is not enough food in it. The interior walls form numerous folds when the stomach contracts. These folds (rugae) dissappear when the organ exits its contracted form.
</p>
<p>
    The stomach’s muscles rarely rest. They knead and mix the food with the gastric juice through periodic contractions constantly. The food becomes a semifluid substance called chyme. The muscles also wave the food into the small intestine, with help of peristaltic contractions. These contractions continue even after all food has exited the stomach. This can lead to ache after a significant amount of time, which we perceive as hunger. This belly ache can also be caused by the blood sugar levels.
</p>
<p>
    The absorption of substances in the stomach is negligible, but things like alcohol, drugs iron are absorbed directly. The stomach is mainly controlled by the vagus nerve and the sympathetic nerve system. Emotions can alter how the stomach works.
</p> 
<p>
    The gastric juice (or gastric acid) is an acid that has a low pH, so it’s acidic, and is located in the stomach. This acid activates enzymes (e.g. pepsin). These pepsin cut protein so our body gets amino acids. The gastric acid is neutralized by bicarbonate in the duodenum.
