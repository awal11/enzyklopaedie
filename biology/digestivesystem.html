<h2> The Digestive System </h2>
<p>
    The digestive system is responsible for the digestion of food and the extraction of  nutrients, so that the body can later use them. Digestive system has two types of organs: the organs connected to the digestive tract (i.e. stomach, esophagus, etc.) and the subsidary organs of the digestion (i.e. liver, gall bladder, etc.). While the organs that belong to the digestive tract are directly involved with the processing of food, i.e. the nutrition goes through them, the subsidary organs only help digesting the food by producing substances. These substances chemically decompose the food.

<h3 id='mouth'> The Mouth </h3>
<p>
    The mouth (latin: os) is the first stop for the food inserted  in our body. It’s also the “entrance” for it and is a part of the digetive tract. With help of the teeth and the tongue, it starts crushing the food mechanically.
    The salivary glands are connected to the mouth and send saliva inside of it, that mixes the crushed food to a mash so it’s not to difficult to swallow it. After the food has been processed, it goes in the food pipe and starts its way to the stomach.
</p>
<p>
    The saliva has different enzymes (e.g. amylase). They start the digestion of the carbohydrates. There are also oral microorganisms, that also help with the digestion. The microorganisms are located between the teeth, on the tongue and in the mucosa.
</p>
<p>
    The taste buds are placed on the tongue. They have many receptor cells, that make us taste. They perceive the taste after they come in contact with the taste substances, that are dissolved in saliva. The saliva also has the task of preventing the mucosa from drying. It also has the function of neutralizing the pH so it doesn’t damage our body.
</p>
<p>
    The mouth muscles also show the emotions we are having through laughing, smiling, etc.
</p>


<h3 id='foodpipe'> The Esophagus/The Food Pipe </h3>
<p>
    The esophagus (also spelled oesophagus) is a muscular tube. Food goes through it from the mouth to the stomach. The food pipe can contract and expand to allow food to pass through. The location of the esophagus is behind the trachea and the heart and in front of the spine. Both ends are closed off by the sphincters (the anterior and the upper). They are muscular narrowings at both ends of the food pipe.
</p>
<p>
    The upper sphincter is basically made of circular muscle tissues, which stay closed almost the shole time. They relax if food has to enter the food pipe. Moments after the food entered the esophagus the sphincter closes. By doing this it prevents the nutrition from coming back. Contractions of the peristalsis move the food to the stomach. Once it reached the anterior sphincter, this opens and lets the food enter the stomach, where it can be digested by gastric juices.
</p>



<h3 id='stomach'> The Stomach </h3>
<p>
    The stomach is the organ where a part of the digestion takes place. The gastric juices process the food chemically. After that it mechanically distributes the food into the intestines.
</p>
<p>
    The human stomach is subdivided into four regions. The cardiac opening (opening from the esophagus into the stomach), the “body” (the central and largest region), the antrum (the lowermost portion) and the pylorus (contraction where food enters the intestine). Each opening (the cardiac and the pyloric) are closed by sphincter muscles, that only open when the food is ready for the final phases of its digestion.
</p>
<p>
    The stomach is able to contract if there is not enough food in it. The interior walls form numerous folds when the stomach contracts. These folds (rugae) dissappear when the organ exits its contracted form.
</p>
<p>
    The stomach’s muscles rarely rest. They knead and mix the food with the gastric juice through periodic contractions constantly. The food becomes a semifluid substance called chyme. The muscles also wave the food into the small intestine, with help of peristaltic contractions. These contractions continue even after all food has exited the stomach. This can lead to ache after a significant amount of time, which we perceive as hunger. This belly ache can also be caused by the blood sugar levels.
</p>
<p>
    The absorption of substances in the stomach is negligible, but things like alcohol, drugs iron are absorbed directly. The stomach is mainly controlled by the vagus nerve and the sympathetic nerve system. Emotions can alter how the stomach works.
</p>
<p>
    The gastric juice (or gastric acid) is an acid that has a low pH, so it’s acidic, and is located in the stomach. This acid activates enzymes (e.g. pepsin). These pepsin cut protein so our body gets amino acids. The gastric acid is neutralized by bicarbonate in the duodenum.
</p>



<h3 id='smallintestine'>  The Small intestine </h3>
<p>
    The small intestine is a long and narrow tube, which links the stomach and the large intestine. Most of the digestion and the absorption takes place in the small intestine. It is about 7 meters long, it’s higlhy tangled and is placed in the abdominal cavity. The mesentery, a thin membranous (separating from other enviroments) material, that somewhat supports and suspends the intestine. The mensentery contains many blood vessels as well as fat, that retains the temperature of the intestines. The small intestine is also connected to various nerves that generate the perestalsis.
</p>
<p>
    The small intestine is subdivised in three successive regions: the duodenum, the jejunum and the ileum. The three of them make a continious tube. Although they show differences and unique characteristics, there are no marked separations.
</p>
<p>
    The duodenum is adjacent to the stomach. It has the widest diameter, is only 23 to 28 centimeters long and it’s not supported by the mensentary. Ducts from the liver, the gall bladder and the pancreas lead substances in it that neutralize the gastric acid. The juices also help digest proteins, fats and carbohydrates.
</p>
<p>
    The jejunum follows after the duodenum. It’s about 2 fifths of the remaining small intestine. Its colour is deep red because of the extensive blood supply, and the peristaltic movements are rapid. The mensentery has low fat levels in this region.
</p>
<p>
    The ileum is the last region of the small intestine. It’s located in the lower abdomen. The blood supply is limited, the peristaltic movements slower and the walls are thinner. The mensentery also has more fatty areas.
</p>
<p>
    The mucous membrace form in creatures like the humans figerlike projections known as vili project into the cavity. This structures highly increase the absorbtion surface. Peristaltic waves move materials in the small intestines, while churning movements called rhythmic segmentation. These movements mix the food with the enzymes, break materials and push it against the wall so it can absorb important substances.
</p>



<h3 id='largeintestine'> The Large intestine </h3>
<p>
    The large intestine is the last part of the intestine. It is subdivided into four regions: cecum, colon, rectum and anus. The whole large intestine is sometimes called colon, which actually also is one of the regions. The large intestine is shorter than the small intestine (1.5 meters, while the small intestine is almost 7 meters), but it is also wider and it has smooth walls. In the upper part, around half of the large intestine, enzymes finish the digestive process and bacterias produce B vitamins as well as K vitamins.
</p>
<p>
    The main function, however, is the absorption of the remaining water and electrolytes from the digestive residues, the remainigs of the food when it enters the large intestine, and storing the fecal matter, the useless remains, until they are expelled. Churning movements lead to the digestive residues to be pushed against the absorbing walls. The gastrocolic reflex propells the residues in the anus. This only occurs 2 or 3 times a day and leads to defecation.
</p>



<h3 id='liver'> The Liver </h3>
<p>
    The liver is the largest gland in our body. It has many functions, including metabolizing substances like proteines, fats and carbohydrates, secreting bile, a digestive fluid, storing substances like glycogen and vitamins, removing toxic substances from the blood, regulating the blood volume and destroying old blood cells.  The liver consists of a mass of cells tunnelled by blood vessels and bile ducts. Hepatic cells make up to 60 percent of the tissue and perform more metabolic functions than any other cells. The other cells, the Kupffer cells. They are important in blood formation, antibody production, and ingestion of foreign particles and cellular debris.
</p>
<p>
    Each day, the liver secretes bile that contains necessary salts for the of fats. Bile is also responsible for the excretion of some metabolic products, drugs and toxic substances. The duct that carries bile leads from the liver into the duodenum. The duodenum is also connected to the gall bladder, which stores the bile and secretes it if it’s needed. The bile is greenish-orange. The bilirubin, a pigment, causes this. Senescent (worn-out) blood cells are also destroyed in the livers, spleen or bone marrow.
</p>
<p>
    The liver also synthezises a lot of enzymes. It filters them out of the blood flowing either through the portal vein and hepatic artery. Nutrients are either formed so they can be usable, but they are also stored so they can be used later. Fats are converted into carbohydrates, then took by the blood to the tissue where it can be further metabolized. Sugar is coverted into glycogen, which is stored in the liver until it’s needed for energy production. It is then reconverted into glucose and released into the blood. The liver also manufactures blood serum, the liquid part of the blood. The liver also metabolizes waste products and detoxifies substances, making them ready for elimination of feces and urine.
</p>



<h3 id='gallbladder'> The Gall Bladder </h3>
<p>
    The gallbladder (or gall bladder) is a muscular mambranous sac. It stores bile and concentrates it, and secretes it if it is needed for digestion. It has a capacity of around 50 ml. The inner wall has mucous-membrane tissue similar to the one of the small intestine. They have millions of microvilli, that increase the area of fluid absorption. It absorbs the water and the sals out of the bile.
</p>
<p>
    The contractions of the gallbladder, that secrete bile into the duodenum, are generated by the vagus nerve and the cholecystokinin. This hormone is produced in the gallbladder. The duct that leads the bile is composed out of 3 “branches”, forming an Y. The lower part leads into the duodenum through the duodenal wall in the small intestine. A sphincter muscle, the sphincter of Oddi, regulates the flow of the bile into the small intestine, if food is present there. The right branch leads into the liver, the left into the gallbladder.
</p>


<h3 id='pancreas'> The Pancreas </h3>
<p>
    The pancreas is a gland that discharges enzymes into the intestine. It also secretes the vital insuline and glucagon into the bloodstream. It is adjacent to the duodenum, weighs about 80 grams and has the shape of a pear. In adults, most of the pancreatic tissue has exocrine functions, secreting enzymes useful for the digestion. The acinar cells produce these digestive enzymes. Their name is from latin acrinus, which means grape, and they are called like that because of their formations look like a cluster of grapes. Between them are the islets of Langerhans located, that are devoted to the endocrine tasks of the pancreas.
</p>
<p>
    The digestive enzymes help with the digestion of fats, proteins and carbohydrates. They pass through ducts from the pancreas into the duodenum. Their flow is controlled by the hormones cholecystokinin and secretin, but also by the vagus nerve. The hormones are released in blood when foods enter the duodenum. When the pancreas receives the hormones, it produces large amounts of water, bicarbonate and enzymes, which are released into the duodenum.
</p>
<p>
    The endocrine part of the pancreas weighs only about 1 gram and has around 1 million cells. The beta cells produce insulin. About 75% of the endocrine cells are beta cells. The rest produces either glucagon, somatostatin or pancreatic polypeptide. Each Langerhans islet (they have the hormone producing cells) is connected to one or two arterioles, that branch into numerous cappillaries. These cappillaries emerge into veins. The main function of the endocrine pancreas is secreting the hormones, which are necessary for the regulation of storage or mobilization of glucose, amino acids and triglycerides in the cells. The functions of the islets are controlled by cirulating metabolites or hormones, nerves or local hormones. While insulin makes the cells store glucose as glycogen, glucagon makes them release glucose into the bloodstream.
