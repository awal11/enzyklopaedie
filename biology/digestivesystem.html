<h2> The Digestive System </h2>
<p>
    The digestive system is responsible for the digestion of food and the extraction of  nutrients, so that the body can later use them. Digestive system has two types of organs: the organs connected to the digestive tract (i.e. stomach, esophagus, etc.) and the subsidary organs of the digestion (i.e. liver, gall bladder, etc.). While the organs that belong to the digestive tract are directly involved with the processing of food, i.e. the nutrition goes through them, the subsidary organs only help digesting the food by producing substances. These substances chemically decompose the food.

<h3 id='mouth'>
    The mouth (latin: os) is the first stop for the food inserted  in our body. It’s also the “entrance” for it and is a part of the digetive tract. With help of the teeth and the tongue, it starts crushing the food mechanically. 
    The salivary glands are connected to the mouth and send saliva inside of it, that mixes the crushed food to a mash so it’s not to difficult to swallow it. After the food has been processed, it goes in the food pipe and starts its way to the stomach.
    The saliva has different enzymes (e.g. amylase). They start the digestion of the carbohydrates. There are also oral microorganisms, that also help with the digestion. The microorganisms are located between the teeth, on the tongue and in the mucosa.
    The taste buds are placed on the tongue. They have many receptor cells, that make us taste. They perceive the taste after they come in contact with the taste substances, that are dissolved in saliva. The saliva also has the task of preventing the mucosa from drying. It also has the function of neutralizing the pH so it doesn’t damage our body.
    The mouth muscles also show the emotions we are having through laughing, smiling, etc.
