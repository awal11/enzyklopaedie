    <h2>What are organs?</h2>


    <p>
        Organs are parts of our body, which are vital. Each of them has a different purpose, for example cleaning the blood, excreting toxic substances or pumping nutrients that help you stay fit to your body.

        When you hear the term "organs", you probably think about the heart, the lungs or the kidneys. But the bones, muscles and the brain are also biological structures, that count as organs. The biggest one is, possibly surprisingly for you, the skin.

        Although each organ has its own function, they are categorized into seweral organ systems. Each member of an organ system has similar tasks to the other ones and helps them in completing their work. Sometimes organs even complete the work started by some other ones. An example of an organ system would be the digestive system, which contains body parts like the food pipe, the stomach and the intestines.

        Body parts are also split in two categories: the internal and the external organs. The second ones refer to the body parts, that are visible to the eye or allow us to percive the world, while the internal organs refer to the ones placed inside the abdomen, the rib cage or the skull. However some newer definitions of the internal organs describe them as organs, that aren't visible to the naked eye. An example for an internal body part would be the stomach, while the nose is an ideal exemplification of the external organs.
