     <h2>What are organs?</h2>

   <p>Organs are parts of our body, which are vital. Each of them has a different purpose, for example cleaning your blood, excreting toxic substances and pumping nutrients that help you stay fit to your body.

    When you hear the term "organs", you probably think about the heart, the lungs or the kidneys. But the bones, muscles and the brain are also biological structures, that count as organs. The biggest one is, maybe surprisingly for you, the skin.

   Although each organ has its own function, they are categorized into organ systems. Each member of an organ system has similar tasks to the other ones and helps them in completing their work. Sometimes some organs even complete the work started by some other ones. An example would be the digestive system, which contains body parts like the food pipe, the stomach and the intestines.
