<h2> The Respiratory System </h2>
<p>  The respiratory system is responsible for breathing and inhaling vital oxygen. It also has the task of expelling CO2 (FARTING). After the oxygen has been inhaled it is inserted into the blood, which takes the oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues.  While the tissue takes the oxygen from the blood, it gives carbon dioxide in the blood, which is taken to the lungs, the main organs of the respiratory system, and after that it’s expelled from the body. </p>

<h3 id='nasalcavity'> Nasal cavity </h3>
<p>
    After the air entered our body it first passes through the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity is a large space filled with air above and behind the nose. It’s first task is to either cool or heat the air to about the same temperature as our body And to humidify the air. The nasal hair and the mucosa inside the nasal cavity clean the dust particles and part of bacteria and the viruses. The mucosa is covered by mucus which also filters the air. The cilia, organelles in most of the cells, move the mucus and the particulate matter through the pharynx into the esophagus, which leads the mucus into the stomach where it’s digested.
</p>
<p>
    The nasal cavity also is responsible for us sensing different smells. It also contributes to the sensing of tastes and flavours.

<h3 id='pharynx'> Pharynx </h3>
<p>
    The pharynx (Greek: “throat”) is a chamber that follows the nasal cavity and is connected to the larynx and the esophagus. It doesn’t have just respiratory functions, but also digestive functions, since the pharynx’s muscles, which are connected to the base of the skull, help push the food inside of the esophagus and prevent air from being swallowed.
</p>
<p>
    The pharynx is subdivided into 3 parts: the nasal pharynx, the oral pharynx and the laryngeal pharynx. The nasal pharynx is basically the anterior region of the nasal cavity. The oral pharynx begins in the mouth and down the throat. There is a flap of tissue that covers the air passage to prevent food from entering the lungs. The isthmus connects the oral pharynx with the nasal pharynx. It allows us breathe through the mouth and, if necessary, insert food through the nose. The third region, the laryngeal pharynx, leads the food into the esophagus and the air into the larynx. The pharynx also has 2 tubes connected to the middle ears, which help regulate the air pressure on the eardrums.
