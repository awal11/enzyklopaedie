<h2> The Respiratory System </h2>
<p>  The respiratory system is responsible for breathing and inhaling vital oxygen. It also has the task of expelling CO2 (FARTING). After the oxygen has been inhaled it is inserted into the blood, which takes the oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues.  While the tissue takes the oxygen from the blood, it gives carbon dioxide in the blood, which is taken to the lungs, the main organs of the respiratory system, and after that it’s expelled from the body. </p>

<h3 id='nasalcavity'> Nasal cavity </h3>
<p>
    After the air entered our body it first passes through the nasal cavity. The nasal cavity is a large space filled with air above and behind the nose. It’s first task is to either cool or heat the air to about the same temperature as our body And to humidify the air. The nasal hair and the mucosa inside the nasal cavity clean the dust particles and part of bacteria and the viruses. The mucosa is covered by mucus which also filters the air. The cilia, organelles in most of the cells, move the mucus and the particulate matter through the pharynx into the esophagus, which leads the mucus into the stomach where it’s digested.
</p>
<p>
    The nasal cavity also is responsible for us sensing different smells. It also contributes to the sensing of tastes and flavours.
</p>


<h3 id='pharynx'> Pharynx </h3>
<p>
    The pharynx (Greek: “throat”) is a chamber that follows the nasal cavity and is connected to the larynx and the esophagus. It doesn’t have just respiratory functions, but also digestive functions, since the pharynx’s muscles, which are connected to the base of the skull, help push the food inside of the esophagus and prevent air from being swallowed.
</p>
<p>
    The pharynx is subdivided into 3 parts: the nasal pharynx, the oral pharynx and the laryngeal pharynx. The nasal pharynx is basically the anterior region of the nasal cavity. The oral pharynx begins in the mouth and down the throat. There is a flap of tissue that covers the air passage to prevent food from entering the lungs. The isthmus connects the oral pharynx with the nasal pharynx. It allows us breathe through the mouth and, if necessary, insert food through the nose. The third region, the laryngeal pharynx, leads the food into the esophagus and the air into the larynx. The pharynx also has 2 tubes connected to the middle ears, which help regulate the air pressure on the eardrums.
</p>


<h3 id='larynx'> Larynx </h3>
<p>
    The larynx, also called the voice box, is a tube that leads the air from the pharynx to the trachea. It also produces vocal sounds and prevents food from entering the trachea. The larynx is made out of cartilages, which prevent it from collapsing. These plates, made out of cartilage, are held together by membrane and muscle fibers. These cartilages also form the Adam’s apple. The cartilage plates tend to be replaced by bone cells.
</p>
<p>
    The epiglottis is a flaplike projection into the throat. When food enters the mouth, the whole larynx rises to the epiglottis. This way it blocks the entrance to the respiratory tract. After the food enters the esophagus, the larynx relaxes.
</p>
<p>
    The larynx has two openings on two sites. Both sites have large folds in the mucous membrane of the larynx. While the first pair is known as the “false” vocal cords, is the second pair known as the true vocal cords, glottis. Speech is produced by air coming from the lungs, which vibrate the vocal cords. Sound exits the larynx, which after that is resonated in the upper cavities. Eventually, we shape the sounds into letters, which ultimately form words. If the larynx is removed, the human body can still produce sounds through the esophagus, but it works worse.
</p>


<h3 id='trachea'> Trachea </h3>
<p>
    The trachea is a tube which leads the air from the larynx into the main bronchi, which ultimately lead the oxygen into the lungs. In most mammalian creatures, the tube is protected by a cartilage structure. The trachea has the task of warming the air and prevent foreign particles from entering the lungs. It has a mucous-membrane layer full of cilia. Those cilia trap particles. There are also ducts that secrete mucous and water. There are also a lot of lymphatic vessels that have the task to take the foreign particles away.
</p>
<p>
    The trachea is held together by some cartilage rings. The trachea can ascend and descend while breathing. Muscle fibers are along the cartilage rings. They narrow and shorten the trachea if needed. This happens when e.g. they have to prevent too cold air and smoke from entering the lungs. Coughing also works like that.
</p>
<p>
    Before entering the lungs, the air also passes through the bronchi, a system of canals which lead the air to the air sacs, or alveoli, where the oxygen is added to the blood and carbon dioxide is removed.
</p>


<h3 id='lungs'> Lungs </h3>
<p>
    The lungs are the large breathing organs located in our chest. They are responsible for exchanging the carbon dioxide in our blood with oxygen, which is vital for the human body. Each of them is located into a membranous sac, the pleura. It is connected to the bronchi, which ultimately lead to the trachea, and to the pulmonary arteries. The lungs are soft, light, spongy, elastic organs. If they are healthy, they will float on water, if not, they will sink.
</p>
<p>
    The hilum is the point where the bronchi, the arteries, the lymphatic vessels and the nerves enter the lung. It's about 2/3 of the actual length of the lung. After entering the lung, the primary bronchi split into many branches. This makes them look like a tree. All of these branches are connected to the alveoli. Each lung is divided into lobes. The right lung has 3 lobes, while the smaller left lung has 2 lobes. The lobes are divided from each other by tissue. Each lobe is itself subdivided into many lobules. Each lobule contains a bronchiole and branches of it, which lead to the alveoli on the walls of the lobule.
</p>
<p>
    The alveoli, or pulmonary alveoli, are responsible for the exchange of gases. Like already mentioned, they give CO2 and take oxygen to distribute it into the body. The alveoli form some clusters, the alveolar sacs, which resemble grapes.
