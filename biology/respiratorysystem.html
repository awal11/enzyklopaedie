<h2> The Respiratory System </h2>
<p>  The respiratory system is responsible for breathing and inhaling vital oxygen. It also has the task of expelling CO2 (FARTING). After the oxygen has been inhaled it is inserted into the blood, which takes the oxygen and other nutrients to the tissues.  While the tissue takes the oxygen from the blood, it gives carbon dioxide in the blood, which is taken to the lungs, the main organs of the respiratory system, and after that it’s expelled from the body. </p>
