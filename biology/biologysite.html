<a href='organs.html'> Organs </a>
<p>
    Organs are parts of our body. Each of them contributes to us staying alive by executing specific tasks. In this article we will help you understand the organs and introduce you to the topic of anatomy.

<a href='../biology/digestivesystem.html'> Digestive System </a>
<p>
    The digestive system is responible for breaking the nutrients we take in with food into substances, that can be used by our body.

<a href='../biology/respiratorysystem.html'> Respiratory System </a>
<p>
    The respiratory system is responsible for us breathing and inhaling vital oxygen. It also has the task of expelling CO2. After inhaling the oxygen it is inserted into the blood, which takes the oxygen and other nutrients to tissues.  While the tissue takes the oxygen from the blood, it gives carbon dioxide in the blood, which is taken to the lungs, the main organs of the respiratory system, and after that itâ€™s expelled from the body.

<a href='../biology/circulatorysystem.html'> Circulatory System </a>
<p>
    Every animal needs the circulatory system for living since they need blood to transport vital substances to each cell. The heart pumps blood into the body and into the lungs, so it's one of the most important organs of the human body.
</p>
<a href='../biology/nervoussystem.html'> Nervous System </a>
<p>
    The nervous system is an organ system consisting of various nerves and the brain. It controls everything our body does, so no other organs and organ systems would function without it. The nerves are like strings connecting the brain to the rest of the body.
