    Every animal needs the circulatory system for living, since they need blood to transport vital substances to each cell of the body. One of the most important substances transported by the blood is the oxygen. The heart pumps the blood into the body and to the lungs, so it's one of the most important organs of the human body.

    The circulatory system
</h3>
<p>
    The circulatory system is the vital organ system that transports the blood into the whole body. It consists of the heart and many blood vessels. The blood vessels are subdivided into two categories: the arteries, which lead the blood away from the heart, and the veins, which lead the blood to the heart. The arteries mostly contain oxygenated blood, while the blood which circulates through the veins mostly isn't oxygenated. There are also the capillaries, very thin blood vessels used to access even the most isolated cell of our body.

    Our bodies have two different circulations: the systemic circulation and the pulmonary circulation. The systemic circulation is a circuit loop that delivers oxygenated blood from the heart to the cells of our body. The oxygenated blood comes from the lungs to the left heart and is afterwards pumped into the rest of the body. The blood then gives the vital oxygen to the cells and receives the carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is lead through the veins to the right heart, where it is pumped into the pulmonary circulation. The arteries of the pulmonary circulation lead the blood without oxygen to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide is taken out of the blood and oxygen is inserted. The veins lead the now oxygenated blood to the right heart and everything is repeated. These two circulations are vital to us.

    systemic circulation:

    -arteries --> oxygenated blood

    -veins --> blood without oxygen
</p>

    pulmonary circulation:

    -arteries --> blood without oxygen

    -veins --> oxygenated blood
