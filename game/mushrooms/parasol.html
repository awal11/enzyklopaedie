    The parasol mushroom
</h2>
<p>
    The parasol mushroom (Macrolepiota procera) is mostly known for its large and recognisable caps and its distinctive height, the ‘Procera’ part in its name means ‘tall '. The gills have a white to cream color. It's mostly found on meadows and in the woodlands. The parasol mushroom can be confused with the Shaggy parasol, which isn’t poisonous, but is known for causing stomach upsets. Its season lasts from June to August.
