<h2>
    Psilocybin mushrooms
</h2>

<p>
    Psilocybin mushrooms (also known as hallucinogenic or magic mushrooms) contain the drug psilocybin (which is converted into psilocin in the body) and can influence one on various levels.  They can affect all senses, particularly eyesight or hearing and they can cause hallucinations, those are the sensory effects. Furthermore they make the experience more intense, and whether a 'trip', the state you're in after taking the mushrooms is bad or good depends on the environment someone is in after the ingestion of the drug.
